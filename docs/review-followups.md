# Review Follow-ups

Updated: 2026-04-12

## Completed

- `657acd6` `Harden server action form validation`
- `f71a4c3` `Refactor character detail chat state`
- `d405529` `Validate auth and account form actions`
- Aligned RBX/SUU docs and feedback form validation with the current runtime/import contract.
- Replaced dashboard browser `alert` / `confirm` flows with shared confirmation dialogs and toast or inline feedback paths.

## Next Priorities

- Continue `P2-1` by splitting `MessageList` bubble/renderer concerns further now that message tools and history loading are no longer embedded in the main chat shell.

## Optional Follow-up

- Split [CharacterDetailView](/home/tmdduq96kr/projects/rebel-ai/src/app/dashboard/characters/[id]/CharacterDetailView.tsx) further into presentation-focused subcomponents if that screen grows again.
